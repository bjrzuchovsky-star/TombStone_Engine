# Tombstone Engine

Tombstone Engine is a fully custom C++ game engine built for high performance, low-level control, and a streamlined development workflow.  
It is designed around a modular architecture, a custom build system, and a custom rendering backend to ensure predictable behavior and maximum efficiency across all engine operations.

This repository contains the core engine source code, internal tools, and supporting systems used to build and run Tombstone Engine.

---

## Features

### Custom Build System
A dedicated build pipeline designed specifically for the engine's architecture.  
Provides fast compilation, predictable output, and full control over how engine modules are built and linked.

### Custom Rendering Backend
A low-level rendering system focused on speed, stability, and minimal overhead.  
Built to support modern graphics APIs and optimized for high-framerate gameplay and editor performance.

### Modular Engine Architecture
Core systems are separated into clean, independent modules, allowing for:
- Efficient runtime behavior  
- Clear engine structure  
- Easy internal maintenance  
- High scalability for future features  

### Admin / Client / Game Builds
Tombstone Engine is structured into three distinct build types:

- **Admin Build**  
  Full engine + editor tools. Used internally for development, debugging, and engine management.

- **Client Build**  
  Lightweight engine runtime for developers building games on top of Tombstone Engine.

- **Game Build**  
  Stripped-down runtime containing only what shipped games need for execution and performance.

### Performance-Focused Design
Every system is built with performance as the primary goal:
- Minimal abstraction overhead  
- Tight memory usage  
- Predictable update loops  
- High-efficiency rendering path  
- Optimized runtime modules

## Project Goals

- Deliver a fast, stable, and fully custom C++ engine  
- Provide a clean development workflow through custom tooling  
- Maintain strict control over engine behavior and architecture  
- Support high-framerate gameplay and editor performance  
- Offer a clear separation between engine development and game development

## Build Requirements

- C++20 compatible compiler  
- Supported graphics API (Vulkan/DirectX/OpenGL depending on configuration)  
- Platform-specific SDKs as required  
- Custom build system included in this repository

### Admin flow (stub)

`ts_admin` drives a console state machine owned by `src/editor/`:

1. **Loading** -- splash stub; auto-advances after a short tick budget  
2. **Login** -- any non-empty username/password, or `DEV_LOGIN` bypass (`AppFlow::submit_dev_login`); Settings link available  
3. **ProjectManager** -- scans on-disk projects; actions: Open, New 2D Project, Settings, Logout  
4. **Settings** -- edit `projects_root`, username, `auto_login_dev`, theme; returns to Login or ProjectManager  
5. **Editor2D** -- workspace stub panels for 2D projects (3D still "not implemented"); Back returns to ProjectManager  

Hang real ImGui screens on the `IScreen` hooks under `src/editor/screens/` without changing the flow.

### Projects & settings (on disk)

Defaults are **cwd-relative** (portable; no machine-absolute paths):

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `./TombStoneConfig/settings.json` | User settings store |
| `./TombStoneProjects/` | Default `projects_root` (saves/projects folder) |

`settings.json` fields: `projects_root`, `username` (last-used), `auto_login_dev` (bool), `theme` (`dark`/`light` stub), `last_project_path`.

Each project is a folder under `projects_root` with a `project.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "Sample 2D Platformer",
  "dimension": "2d",
  "created": "2026-09-30T00:00:00Z",
  "last_opened": "2026-09-30T00:00:00Z"
}
```

On first run (empty `projects_root`), Admin seeds one sample 2D project. Changing `projects_root` in Settings reloads the project list from the new folder. Local `TombStoneProjects/` and `TombStoneConfig/` are gitignored.

Configure with CMake 3.20+ and a C++20 toolchain. Toggle `TS_BUILD_ADMIN`, `TS_BUILD_CLIENT`, and `TS_BUILD_GAME` as needed.
